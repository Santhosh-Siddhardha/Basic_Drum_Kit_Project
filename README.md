# Basic_Drum_Kit_Project

This is a virtual drum kit project implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding buttons or by using keyboard keys.

## Overview

The drum kit consists of seven buttons, each representing a different drum instrument and associated with specific keyboard keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`). When a button is clicked or its corresponding keyboard key is pressed, the associated drum sound is played along with a brief shadow animation effect.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Users can trigger drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing keyboard keys.
  
- **Sound Effects:** Each button corresponds to a unique drum sound (audio file) played upon interaction.
  
- **Keyboard Support:** Users can play the drum sounds using keyboard keys for a more dynamic experience.
  
- **Visual Feedback:** Clicking a button or pressing a key triggers a temporary shadow animation effect to provide visual feedback.
